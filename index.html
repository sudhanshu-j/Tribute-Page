        Bhagat Singh (born September 27, 1907, Lyallpur, western Punjab, India
        [now in Pakistan]—died March 23, 1931, Lahore [now in Pakistan])
        revolutionary hero of the Indian independence movement. Bhagat Singh
        attended Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School, which was operated by Arya
        Samaj (a reform sect of modern Hinduism), and then National College,
        both located in Lahore. He began to protest British rule in India while
        still a youth and soon fought for national independence. He also worked
        as a writer and editor in Amritsar for Punjabi- and Urdu-language
